Tasks Achieved :
1. Getting user's input from the form and printing available flights
2. Booking a ticket and updating passengers_details table with details of booked tickets
3. Using an insertion script to update passenger details

Bugs Disclosed :
1. If no flight is present, it prints an empty table.
2. In the confirmation form, it displays the first row of the search_details table. This is just a static representation, as the dynamic approach using button ID's did not prove to be successful.
